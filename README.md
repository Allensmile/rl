# torch_rl : A starting Reinforcement Learning PyTorch Library


Torch_rl is a (small) starting RL library for PyTorch that can be used to:
* learn policies over openAI Gym environments
* learn policies with DQN or Policy Gradient techniques
* Model complex environements (not only reward-based environment)

torch_rl will certainly change a lot during the next weeks.... The documentation is included in the docs directory and can be generated using `PYTHONPATH=.. make html` from `docs`
